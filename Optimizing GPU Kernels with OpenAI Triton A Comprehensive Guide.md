### Example 1: Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is a foundational operation in GPU computing. Below are simple and optimized Triton implementations.

#### 1.1 Basic Matrix Multiplication Kernel

```python
import triton
import triton.language as tl

@triton.jit
def matmul_kernel(
    A, B, C,
    M, N, K,
    stride_am, stride_ak,
    stride_bk, stride_bn,
    stride_cm, stride_cn,
    BLOCK_M: tl.constexpr, BLOCK_N: tl.constexpr, BLOCK_K: tl.constexpr
):
    pid = tl.program_id(0)
    block_m = pid // (N // BLOCK_N)
    block_n = pid % (N // BLOCK_N)

    # Initialize accumulator
    acc = tl.zeros((BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N), dtype=tl.float32)

    for k in range(0, K, BLOCK_K):
        a_ptr = A + block_m * BLOCK_M * stride_am + k * stride_ak
        b_ptr = B + k * stride_bk + block_n * BLOCK_N * stride_bn

        a = tl.load(a_ptr, mask=(block_m < M)[:, None])
        b = tl.load(b_ptr, mask=(block_n < N)[None, :])

        acc += tl.dot(a, b)

    c_ptr = C + block_m * BLOCK_M * stride_cm + block_n * BLOCK_N * stride_cn
    tl.store(c_ptr, acc, mask=(block_m < M)[:, None] & (block_n < N)[None, :])
```

import triton.language as tl

# Define the optimized Triton kernel (refer to previous examples)
@triton.jit
def matmul_kernel_optimized(...):
    # Kernel implementation
    pass

# Triton integration function
def triton_matmul(A, B):
    M, K = A.shape
    K, N = B.shape
    C = torch.empty((M, N), device='cuda', dtype=A.dtype)

    # Define block sizes
    BLOCK_M = 128
    BLOCK_N = 128
    BLOCK_K = 32

    # Calculate grid size
    grid = ( (M + BLOCK_M - 1) // BLOCK_M ) * ( (N + BLOCK_N - 1) // BLOCK_N )

    # Launch Triton kernel
    matmul_kernel_optimized[grid](
        A, B, C,
        M, N, K,
        A.stride(0), A.stride(1),
        B.stride(0), B.stride(1),
        C.stride(0), C.stride(1),
        BLOCK_M=BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N=BLOCK_N, BLOCK_K=BLOCK_K
    )
    return C

# Usage Example
A = torch.randn((1024, 1024), device='cuda', dtype=torch.float32)

def conv_kernel_shared_memory(...):
    # Define shared memory buffers
    shared_A = tl.shared_memory((BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), dtype=tl.float32)
    shared_B = tl.shared_memory((BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N), dtype=tl.float32)

    # Load data into shared memory
    shared_A = tl.load(A_ptr, mask=mask_a)
    shared_B = tl.load(B_ptr, mask=mask_b)

    # Synchronize threads
    tl.barrier()

    # Perform computation using shared memory
    acc += tl.dot(shared_A, shared_B)

    # Store the result
    tl.store(C_ptr, acc, mask=mask_c)
```

**Key Points:**

    BLOCK_SIZE = 256
    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE
    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
    mask = offsets < N

    # Ensure aligned memory access
    a = tl.load(A + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)
    b = tl.load(B + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)

    c = a + b
    tl.store(C + offsets, c, mask=mask)
```

**Optimization Highlights:**

    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE
    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
    mask = offsets < N

    # Vectorized load
    a = tl.load(A + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)
    b = tl.load(B + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)

    # Vectorized computation
    c = a + b
